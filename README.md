Launch the app on your Android device either by tapping its icon on the home screen or through the app drawer.
## 2.Add Starting Amounts and person
If you are opening the app for the first time, you will be promted to enter the amounts that you have at the given moment. You will then save the details and a page to add people will be displayed.After entering and saving the person, an empty transactions page will be displayed.
You will not be promted to add any person or amounts if you have previously entered them. The transactions page will be displayed immediately.
## 3.Transaction

Save the transaction and if successful you will see it on the transactions page.
You can edit or delete a transaction by long pressing the transaction and selecting the appropriate command in the pop up. You can also set a transaction as transactional by selecting the command in the pop up. A transaction can only be set as transactional if it is of type mpesa. What setting a transaction as transactional means is that the money was only transferred from mpesa to cash and vice versa. So no money was actually lost or gained. This helps with keeping track of the cash and mpesa amounts at all times.
